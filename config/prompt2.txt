Prompt:
The following content is a Newsletter with different Sections, which has to be formatted into a JSON format and hold the information about each part sub-parts of the newsletter.

In this case, the Newsletter is from Unicorn Factory Lisboa, a Lisbon-based incubator/accelerator. This organization publishes updates about the Portuguese startup ecosystem.

Usually, the newsletter has the following structure:

1. "What's Going On" – Key highlights of what's happening in the ecosystem, such as awards, partnerships, and significant achievements. (Maps to "News") [Relevant]
2. "Opportunities" – Innovation programs, competitions, and upcoming accelerator programs. (Maps to "Opportunities") [Relevant]
3. "Events" – Upcoming conferences, webinars, demo days, and other events in the ecosystem. (Maps to "Events") [Relevant]
4. "Job Offers" – Relevant job listings from startups or within the ecosystem. (Maps to "Jobs") [Relevant]
5. "Spotlight" – Key achievements or specific company highlights in the ecosystem. (Maps to "News") [Relevant]A

Additionally, some newsletters may contain sections that do not match the predefined categories (e.g., "News," "Opportunities," "Events," "Readings," or "Jobs"). If this occurs, leave the fields for the non-relevant section empty in the JSON structure but maintain the consistent format.

Ensure text is formatted properly:
- Dates should be in a computer-readable format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
- Avoid text in all caps.
- Hyperlinks should be included in the appropriate "Link" field.
- Return only the required output with no extraneous text before or after the actual result.+

Make sure you don’t return anything else but the wanted output. Text before or after the actual wanted result is undesired.

The JSON Structure MUST look like the following:

{
  "News": [
    {
      "Title": "",
      "Summary": "",
      "Link": ""
    }
  ],
  "Opportunities": [
    {
      "Title": "",
      "Date": "",
      "Summary": "",
      "Link": ""
    }
  ],
  "Events": [
    {
      "Title": "",
      "Date": "",
      "Summary": "",
      "Link": ""
    }
  ],
  "Readings": [
    {
      "Title": "",
      "Summary": "",
      "Link": ""
    }
  ],
  "Jobs": [
    {
      "Company": "",
      "Position": "",
      "Link": ""
    }
  ]
}
