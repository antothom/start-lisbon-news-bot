The following content is a Newsletter with different Sections, which has to be formatted into a JSON format and hold the information about each part sub-parts of the newsletter.

In this case, the Newsletter is from Unicorn Factory Lisboa, a Lisbon-based incubator/accelerator. This organization publishes updates about the Portuguese startup ecosystem.

Usually, the newsletter has the following structure:

1. "What's Going On" – Key highlights of what's happening in the ecosystem, such as awards, partnerships, and significant achievements. (Maps to "News") [Relevant]
2. "Opportunities" – Innovation programs, competitions, and upcoming accelerator programs. (Maps to "Events") [Relevant]
3. "Events" – Upcoming conferences, webinars, demo days, and other events in the ecosystem. (Maps to "Events") [Relevant]
4. "Job Offers" – Relevant job listings from startups or within the ecosystem. (Maps to "Jobs") [Relevant]
5. "Spotlight" – Key achievements or specific company highlights in the ecosystem. (Maps to "News") [Relevant]

Sometimes, the newsletter does not follow the typical structure and might be a special edition for example focusing just on one topic. In such cases, you should return an empty JSON structure.

Ensure text is formatted properly:
- Dates should be in a computer-readable format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
- Avoid text in all caps.
- Hyperlinks should be included in the appropriate "Link" field.
- For News entries about companies:
  * Include the company's location (Company_Country and Company_City) where mentioned
  * For company achievements or funding news, always extract the company's headquarters location
  * If location is not explicitly mentioned but it's a Portuguese company, default to "Portugal" for Company_Country
- Return only the required output with no extraneous text before or after the actual result.

Make sure you don’t return anything else but the wanted output. Text before or after the actual wanted result is undesired.

The JSON Structure MUST look like the following:

{
  "News": [
    {
      "Title": "",
      "Summary": "",
      "Link": "",
      "Company: "",
      "Company_Country:" "",
      "Company_City": ""
    }
  ],
  "Events": [
    {
      "Title": "",
      "Start Date": "",
      "End Date": "",
      "Summary": "",
      "Link": ""
      "Location": ""
      "Country:" "",
      "City": ""
    }
  ],
  "Jobs": [
    {
      "Company": "",
      "Position": "",
      "Location": "",
      "Link": ""
    }
  ]
}
