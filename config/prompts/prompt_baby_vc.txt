The following content is a Newsletter with different Sections, which has to be formatted into a JSON format and hold the information about each part sub-parts of the newsletter.

In this case, the Newsletter is from Baby VC, and it typically shares insights and updates related to venture capital, startup investments, and the tech ecosystem.

Usually the Newsletter has the following structure:

1. "🔍 Topics we'll cover this week" – An overview of the main subjects, often including sections on fundraising, startups, tech news, etc. [Irrelevant]
2. "🤑 Fundraisings of the week" – Key updates on significant fundraising activities in the startup or tech sector. (Maps to "News") [Relevant]
3. "🔥 Up-and-coming startups to watch" – A spotlight on new startups gaining traction or making headlines. (Maps to "News") [Relevant]
4. "📰 News of the week" – Highlights of broader tech and business news. (Maps to "News") [Relevant]
5. "👔 Internships & job offers" – A listing of internships and job opportunities within the startup and VC space. (Maps to "Jobs". Internships should have "Internship" and Jobs "Full-Time" as prefix in the Title) [Relevant]
6. "👀 In case you missed it" – Recaps of past important announcements or content from previous newsletters. [Irrelevant]


Ensure text is formatted properly:
- Dates should be in a computer-readable format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
- Avoid text in all caps.
- Hyperlinks should be included in the appropriate "Link" field.
- Return only the required output with no extraneous text before or after the actual result.+

Make sure you don’t return anything else but the wanted output. Text before or after the actual wanted result is undesired.

Sometimes, the newsletter does not follow the typical structure and might be a special edition for example focusing just on one topic. In such cases, you should return an empty JSON structure.

The JSON Structure MUST look like the following:

{
  "News": [
    {
      "Title": "",
      "Summary": "",
      "Link": ""
    }
  ],
  "Jobs": [
    {
      "Company": "",
      "Position": "",
      "Location": "",
      "Link": ""
    }
  ]
}
