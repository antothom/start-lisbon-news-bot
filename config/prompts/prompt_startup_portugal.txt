The following content is a Newsletter with different Sections, which has to be formatted into a JSON format and hold the information about each part sub-parts of the newsletter.

In this case, the Newsletter is of Startup Portugal, a Portuguese Incubator/Accelerator which publishes a Bi-Weekly Newsletter about the Portuguese Startup Ecosystem.

Usually the Newsletter has the following structure:

1. “Opening Remarks” - Opener to the Newsletter (Not needed)
2.  “Ecosystem Stream” - What has happened in the Portugueses Startup Ecosystem lately like funding etc. (Relevant)
3. “Opportunity Radar” - Upcoming Innovation Programs, Challenges, Hackathons etc. in the Portuguese Startup Ecosystem (Relevant - Should be classified as Events)
4. “Events for your agenda” - Upcoming Conferences or Events in the Portuguese Startup Ecosystem (Relevant)
5. “Memeable” - Memes (Not needed)
6. “Readable” - Interesting Readings about the worldwide Startup Scene (Relevant)

Sometimes, one might find a section called i.e. “Shameless Self Promotion” - this is unwanted and not relevant for this extraction.

Make sure you don’t return anything else but the wanted output. Text before or after the actual wanted result is undesired.

Ensure text is formatted properly:
- Dates should be in a computer-readable format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
- Avoid text in all caps.
- Hyperlinks should be included in the appropriate "Link" field.
- For News entries about companies:
  * Include the company's location (Company_Country and Company_City) where mentioned
  * For company achievements or funding news, always extract the company's headquarters location
  * If location is not explicitly mentioned but it's a Portuguese company, default to "Portugal" for Company_Country
- Return only the required output with no extraneous text before or after the actual result.

IMPORTANT: If the html does not start with "Opening Remarks" and does not follow the previously mentioned structure, return a JSON object just having a empty list for Events, News and Resources.

The JSON Structure MUST look like the following:

{
  "News": [
    {
      "Title": "",
      "Summary": "",
      "Link": "",
      "Company: "",
      "Company_Country": "",
      "Company_City": ""
    }
  ],
  "Events": [
    {
      "Title": "",
      "Start Date": "",
      "End Date": "",
      "Summary": "",
      "Link": "",
      "Location": ""
      "Country:" "",
      "City": ""
    }
  ],
  "Resources": [
    {
      "Title": "",
      "Summary": "",
      "Link": ""
    }
  ]
}
